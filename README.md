# Magic AutoMapper
Helper to automatic configure mappings with Automapper

## What is Magic AutoMapper?

When we work with AutoMapper in a project normally we have an flat and basic profiles to configure maps like ```csharp Mapper.Map<entity,entityDto>();``` where all properties of DTO type are equals (type and name) than source entity.

Magic AutoMapper simplify the way to configure this maps without need create a especific profiles. Maps will be defined into Dto class declaration.

This library is based in an original idea of Jason Taylor, exposed in NDC Sydney 2019 conference.
